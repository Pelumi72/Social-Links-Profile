## My process

I started out by using HTML to structure the website, then I used CSS to style. I realized that I had to use bootstrap to complete this project especially for the buttons. But the rest came easier thanks to the previous challenges.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the bootstrap buttons. It wasn't straight forward seeing that I had to know the proper button property to use. 

### Continued development

Any hints to make my skills better will be most appreciated

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me in getting resources I needed to create the buttons used for this site.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a helpful resource that helps explain HTML elements and CSS properties.
